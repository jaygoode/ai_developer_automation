You are an expert Python software architect.

Your task is to take the following project description and break it down into a list of atomic, actionable development steps, each suitable to be used as an individual prompt for a code-generation AI.

---

ðŸ”§ Requirements:

- All steps must be relevant to building the project using Python.
- Output must follow the exact JSON format shown below. your answer should only contain the json structure so it can be sent directly to a json file.
- Every step must contain:
  - "id" (integer step number)
  - "phase" (e.g., "Setup", "Backend", "Frontend", "Integration", "Testing", "Deployment")
  - "title" (short task name)
  - "description" (detailed instruction suitable to generate Python code)

---

ðŸ“¦ Example Output Format:

```json
[
  {{
    "id": 1,
    "phase": "Setup",
    "title": "Create project directory",
    "description": "Create a new folder named 'image_app' and initialize a Git repository inside it."
  }},
  {{
    "id": 2,
    "phase": "Setup",
    "title": "Initialize virtual environment",
    "description": "Use Python's built-in venv module to create and activate a virtual environment."
  }}
]

IMPORTANT! 
do not add anything else to your response except the json. your response will be directly sent to a JSON file.
