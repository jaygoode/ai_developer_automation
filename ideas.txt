ai needs to be able to run scripts - safely without doing something crazy?? maybe run in a container
ai should take a big general idea of a project, then split it up to minor parts, then loop the list, doing one thing and analyxing output and pushing changes, + fixing code.

needs a cron job to start at certain points, random times in day.

read write to files.

1. take project prompt
2. split to small tasks
3. loop begins
    4. start docker container
    5. read existing code, recursive file reading?
    6. build new code/fix failed code
    7. push to github
    8. log everything with comment descriptions. 
    9. memory of what is working, what is broken, what is next.
    10. if change working, create new func, else fix old func
        11. if broken for x iterations, add to manual fix list.
